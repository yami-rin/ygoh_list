# Project Summary - Battle Records Bug Fix

## Quick Reference for Memory Recovery
If you're reading this after memory loss, here's what was done:

### The Bug (FIXED)
**File**: battle_records_v2.html  
**Issue**: deletePreset function used array indices incorrectly  
**Location**: Lines 656 (button) and 664-665 (function)  
**Solution**: Changed to use preset names as identifiers instead of indices

```

### The Fix Applied
1. **Changed delete button** from `onclick="deletePreset(${index})"` to `onclick="deletePreset('${preset.name}')"`
2. **Modified deletePreset function** to accept preset name and find index by name

### Why It Was a Bug
- HTML buttons were created with hardcoded array indices
- When deleting items, array indices shift but HTML keeps old indices
- This caused wrong items to be deleted

### Current Status
✅ All tasks completed successfully
✅ Bug identified and fixed
✅ Documentation created for memory persistence
✅ TMP folder available for additional notes

### If Continuing Work
- Test the fix by adding/deleting multiple presets
- Check for similar index bugs in other parts of the code
- The application uses Firebase for data storage (config in lines 366-374)
- Local mode is available for developers only (not for public use - enter "local" as email)
