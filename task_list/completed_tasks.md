# Completed Tasks - 2025-08-20

## Tournament System Improvements

### ✅ Task 1: Fix Tournament Preset Registration
- **Issue**: Preset button wasn't working due to form submission
- **Fix**: Added preventDefault() to the click event handler
- **Location**: battle_records_v2.html, lines 431-434

### ✅ Task 2: Add Edit Button for Tournament Details  
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added edit button with pencil icon for tournament records only
  - Created editTournament() function (lines 888-901)
  - Button appears next to delete button (lines 1096-1100)
  - Opens tournament modal in edit mode with pre-filled data

### ✅ Task 3: Modify Tournament Results to Round-by-Round Input
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced single "Save Results" button with two buttons:
    - "現在のラウンドを保存" (Save Current Round) - Primary button
    - "大会を終了" (End Tournament) - Success button
  - Created saveCurrentRound() function (lines 809-886):
    - Saves one round at a time
    - Disables input fields after saving
    - Tracks saved rounds with savedRounds object
    - Auto-prompts to end tournament when all rounds complete
  - Modified saveTournamentResults() (lines 906-929):
    - Now only ends the tournament
    - Warns about unsaved rounds before ending
    - Resets savedRounds state
