# Fix Applied - Battle Records Index Bug

## Bug Fixed Successfully!
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**File**: battle_records_v2.html

## Changes Made:

### 1. Modified preset delete button (Line 656)
**Before**: `onclick="deletePreset(${index})"`
**After**: `onclick="deletePreset('${preset.name.replace(/'/g, "\\'")}')"` 
- Now passes preset name instead of array index
- Escapes single quotes in preset names to prevent JavaScript errors

### 2. Updated deletePreset function (Lines 664-665)
**Before**: 
```javascript
window.deletePreset = async function(index) {
    presets.splice(index, 1);
```

**After**:
```javascript
window.deletePreset = async function(presetName) {
    const index = presets.findIndex(p => p.name === presetName);
    if (index === -1) return;
    presets.splice(index, 1);
```
- Function now accepts preset name instead of index
- Finds the preset by name
- Safely handles case where preset is not found

## Why This Fixes the Bug:
1. Previously, array indices were hardcoded in HTML onclick handlers
2. When an item was deleted, array indices would shift but HTML still had old indices
3. Now we use preset names as unique identifiers, which don't change when array is modified
4. This ensures the correct preset is always deleted regardless of array mutations

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Add multiple presets
2. Delete a preset from the middle of the list
3. Verify remaining presets can still be deleted correctly
4. Check that preset with apostrophes in names work correctly
