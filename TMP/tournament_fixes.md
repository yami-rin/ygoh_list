# Tournament System Fixes

## Issues to Fix:
1. **Preset Registration Issue**: The addPreset function needs to be called correctly
2. **No Edit Button**: Need to add edit functionality for tournaments
3. **Bulk Input Problem**: Currently saves all rounds at once, need round-by-round input

## Analysis:

### 1. Preset Registration Issue
- Line 429: Event listener is set correctly
- Line 616-640: addPreset function exists and looks correct
- Possible issue: The button might be inside a form causing page reload

### 2. Missing Edit Functionality
- No editTournament function exists
- Need to add edit buttons to tournament records
- Need to create edit modal or reuse tournament modal

### 3. Round-by-Round Input
- Current: Line 802-807 saves all rounds at once
- Need: Save each round individually as it's completed
- Add validation to prevent skipping rounds

## Implementation Plan:
1. Fix preset registration by preventing default form submission
2. Add edit button to each tournament record
3. Create editTournament function
4. Modify saveTournamentResults to save individual rounds
5. Add round completion tracking
