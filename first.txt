First, organize the situation.
Next, create a task list.
Write the task list in detail in the task list folder using MD.
The reason for writing the task list in detail is that your memory will periodically disappear.
So, write it in detail so that you can continue from where you left off even if your memory disappears.
Also, when you complete a task, update the MD file with “completed.”
Also, create a TMP folder.  
In this TMP folder, write down everything you want to remember, such as notes, errors that occurred, and solutions.  
You can write and read freely. Think of it as your second brain.  
I think it will be useful when your memory fades.
